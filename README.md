# project1

My first react project on node js for website and mobile applications

Don't modify anything unless it gets everyfile saved in its current directory location.

Let me know ahead of time if you plan to change a file in its directories' location and why.  

Please let me know which code was changed to get this working in visual studio community and what server it is using.

Please let me know which changes will need to be made to get this project working in host gator and which files to keep an eye on for updating while looking
forward into my coding training journey.

Please let me know how to format my files to ask a question on stackoverflow.com

Thanks!

Andrew
